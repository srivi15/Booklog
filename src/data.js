        review:`Travelling salesman Gregor Samsa wakes up one morning to discover that he has transformed into a bug. He then witnesses the "Metamorphosis" of human emotions and behaviours of people around him. 
        
        Metamorphosis is a biological process of transforming from one form of a person or thing into completely different one. The book is about Metamorphosis of human emotions and behaviour. It's scary that how human emotions change from predictable to unpredictable in a span of hours. A single change can impact so much in life. In the end we are not more than a mere existence in someone's life. I was literally on the verge of crying when the story came to its end.
        Everything about this is "Metamorphosis" in real life,
        
        Though it lacks credibility , the portrayal of human emotions by the author is remarkable.`,

        review:`Animal farm by George Orwell is an allegorical novella that deals with animalism and totalitarianiasm.
        It starts with the animals getting tired of being treated as slaves by the humans. So they decide to get rid of human domination against animals by promoting a system called "Animalism" where they will be free of human domination.
        They formulate seven commandments to abide by for animal welfare by eliminating any kind of association with human life style.
        But with freedom comes power. And with power comes lust which leads them to even worse predicament than they had been under humans before.
        
        It is not an unknown fact that "with sense comes greater troubles". Manipulation can drive people to do unimaginable deeds. The story was going in a smooth solid pace until a point where everything escalated into something else. That is the negative shade of the freedom. There were many moments where i could realize how much Manipulation and memory play the major roles in our lives. Our memories are not very strong. They can be manipulated and tampered with very easily which can lead us to our doom if left unattended. In the end, i couldn't be more relieved at the fact that animals have no sixth sense. We definitely do not want a world war between animals and humans.
        Over all it was a good read but i was bit disappointed that the author didn't bother to show the animals of the cruelties that napoleon had done to them in the name of welfare. I still wonder what might have happened to animal farm after the bitter revelation.`,

        review:`Well, I became an enormous fan of Sudeep , Because his writing says about the significance of love, friendship, family, hurt, even loss. I think these are the "password to our life". Your the password to my Life
        The best creation of Indian Novelist Sudeep Nagarkar . Story starts at Pune between two college best friends , their name with five alphabets each "Virat and Kavya". They never fail to protect each other. Virat fell in love with Mehak and he couldn't find any reason for his change other than mehak. She changed his life and respect virat and kavya friendship. They enjoy small little things in life which later please them with beautiful package of memories. But another love-story flourishes between Rohan who is Mahek’s cousin with riddhima , his French tutor. When life is about to bring happiness, why did life shatter for Mehak and Kavya ?
        On February 14th, all were set for celebration and waiting for Virat and his gifts. Kavya called Virat and asking how long will it take him to be at Riddhima’s place and he says he is at German bakery and will be coming in 20mins. When he is about to leave to Riddhima’s place , bomb blast occurs and he sees people running around him and his memory with mehak, kavya, riddhima and roshan flashes away and he dies. Realising the fact now, kavya cannot play with no more Virat, Mehak lost love of her life, roshan and riddhima lost their smile. Losing someone you love is more painful than losing yourself. Five letter VIRAT has become a "PASSWORD" in everyone's life.
        Is loving someone our fault ? or Blessings ? "Zindagi ko badalne me waqt nahi lagta , Par kabhi kabhi waqt ko badalne me zindagi lag jati hai!!'" "WHEN YOU TRUST A PERSON WITH ALL YOUR HEART,YOU WILL EITHER GET A FRIEND FOR LIFE OR LESSON FOR LIFE"`,

        review:`The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a book of twenty six poetic essays along with the illustrations drawn by the author himself.
        
        The book is about the wise sayings of the Prophet who was asked questions about life and it's purposeful concepts by the people of orphalese before the Prophet can set out on a voyage to another place.
        It is a nice book to read if you are a lover of poetries in the form of religious perspectives. It contains archaic language in some places since it was written a long time ago. There are few lines which are really good which I would like to add it here, "The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain" - Joy and Sorrow. "The lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral" - Houses. "Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean" - Clothes. "Your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom" -Freedom.
        
        I don't want to rate this book because at some places i was so enchanted by it that i would give it 5 stars but at some places it was dragging and beating around the bush to make it more metaphorical which didn't entertain me much that i would give it 3 stars.
        But i would strongly recommend this to those who love literary books.`,

        rating:4.5,
        review:`The Yellow wallpaper is a short story by American writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman.
        The story is partly based on the author's experience with her physician.
        
        The protagonist is the narrator of the story who has been suffering from post partum depression after child birth. Her husband John who is a physician disregards her depression into saying she is fine and she just needs a "rest cure" which restricts her from doing any work that results in physical and mental stress. So they move to a new house for spending summer vacation so that she can feel better. But unfortunately it makes her condition even worse. Her husband doesn't listen to anything she says which leads her to get obsessed with the shoddy yellow wallpaper in their room.
        So i heard there are different interpretations of this story. Some of them being , women oppression , male domination and medical shortcomings. But i do agree with the medical error here. One should not overlook or disregard anything thinking it is not serious. Telling someone they are fine is okay but if they themselves say they are not,it needs to be attended differently and not indifferently. Forcing someone into believing that they are okay when they are actually not will only make it worse. And depriving them of the activities in which they feel comfort will drive them into worse temperaments. I think anyone who has suffered from depression could understand the author's perspective here. The end was bit creepy to me but all along the story was worth the read. You can read this in your recess time between work or studies since it is very short.`,

        review:`The blue umbrella is a novella by Ruskin Bond who is an Indian author of british descent. It is a beautiful story of a little girl and her love towards her blue umbrella.
        
        Binya is a 10 year old country girl who acquires a blue umbrella from the picnickers in exchange for her lucky leopard claw pendant. The blue umbrella attracts the people of the village that creates envy among the people and a certain shopkeeper called Ram Bharosa who wants to have it by hook or crook.
        
        This is the first Ruskin Bond book i have read. And I am already in love with this. This is the cutest book i have ever read in a long while. It gives an aesthetic feel and imagination that pleases and calms our mind relieving us from all the stress. I was so overwhelmed with emotions in the end of the story that it made me smile with no worries of the world. It is even safe to say that it has become my favourite book now. This is a must read for everyone since I don't see why one should not read it.`,

        The narrator is a pilot who is stranded on the sahara desert after a force landing. He befriends a little prince from another planet who in turn shares his experience and memories of his exploration mission with the pilot before departing to his own planet.
        
        
        This book is so beautifully written that it has left a deep impact in my mind and heart. I didn’t want the book to end. It was as if i had been in that desert with the prince instead of the pilot. It made me so heartbroken when the little prince left for his planet.
        
        For a kid, this is just a story. But for an adult who had been taken granted as a child, this book for sure is something else that one would want to treasure.
        
        The beauty of this book is that it insists on a message that is often overlooked by many people. A child’s mind is where innovation and creativity is born. I think many adults can relate to this story well. As kids we might have been deprived of many things just because they didn't make sense to grown ups. Maybe that's why this book has left a permanent mark in my heart.
        
        There are so much good stuffs in this book, but this specific line from the book is very precious, “What is essential is invisible to the eye” .
        More than a story, this book is a plethora of human emotions and a perfect blend of friendship, attachment and responsibilities.
        
        I am still not over this book. This is a must read for everyone irrespective of the age and genre.`,

        Jonathan is a seagull who is bored of his normal gull life. Instead of his normal routine of squabbling for fish, he wants to master in flight and speed. But that doesn't come easy.
        
        
        This is a great self help book in the form of a fable so that anyone can read it. We don't always achieve our goals due to the boundaries set by the society. One must break free from all the pre conceived notions and baseless stereotypes in order to achieve what we want to do in life. Purpose of life lies in the desire to live as per our Heart's wishes. Our ultimate aim is to achieve that purpose. But it is not always easy. We have to make sacrifices. Sometimes we need to break few rules in order to stand out from others. We need to hear some discouraging words and need to go through hate. But in the end, it will all be worth it. No matter what we go through we must not falter in our steps and achieve our purpose in life. Otherwise our life will be meaningless and as blank as the blank paper. This book is all about this. This is a great book for those who need motivation in life.

Then she meets Vivaan, a successful banker at a book reading session and she falls in love with him. They both spend time together in Kabir's coffee shop, who is a hardworking manager and also a good friend of Meera and Vivaan. Kabir falls in love with a girl named Nisha and proposes to her. One day, Vivaan quits his job and leaves India without saying good bye to Meera.

        Her life changes after that. She loses hope and falls into depression.
        
        What happens to Vivaan and Meera ? Did he return to India ? What happened in Kabir and Nisha's life ? This is what the story is about.
        
        The writing style of the author is full of emotions and touching. She lifted the story with 4 different characters.

        review:`Milk and honey is a collection of poetry and prose by Rupi Kaur. It also has illustrations by the author.

        
        This book consists of four sections, the hurting, the loving, the breaking and the healing.
        The first section is about child abuse, women abuse and women objectification and suppression that got the poet to pour out all her emotions in her words.
        The second section is about love and passion.
        The third section is about break ups and betrayals and the last section is about healing process and self love.
        
        
        I must say, this is one of the most influential books i have ever read. As a girl, I can feel each and every word the poet has written with such poignant emotions. My favourite sections are 'the hurting' and 'the healing'. It's not like i don't like other two sections, but the fact that all women undergo mental trauma , sexual abuse and harassment at some point in their lives makes it more special and relatable to me. There are so many favourites in this book, i would like to mention few:
        
        "If you were born with the weakness to fall
        You were born with the strength to rise" -The healing
        
        "Loneliness is a sign you are in desperate need of yourself" -The healing
        
        "You have sadness living in places sadness shouldn't live" - The hurting
        
        I could make a book out of my favourite poems if i want because there are so many.
        More than women, i think men need to read this to know what women feel and go through.
        I highly recommend this to all above 18 years of age. Also this is not a children book.`,

        review:`The old man and the sea is a novella by Ernest Hemingway.

        
        Santiago is an old fisher man who goes for fishing only to return empty handed for the past 84 days. So the parents of a boy named Manolin don't want him to fish with Santiago since they considered Santiago unlucky. The next day, the old man goes for fishing again, but this time a big fish takes his bait. At the same time it drags him far away from the shore. The story then focuses on the struggles the old man faces while finding a way back to home.
    
        
        This book gives an insight about ageing and the hardships that accompany it. The positive aspect of the story lies in the determination and perseverance held by the old man. People will say so many things. They will change their perspectives everyday but we must not falter in our steps and achieve what we want. Mental strength is more important than physical strength. While reading the book i was constantly reminded of the proverb "If there is a will , there is a way". Age doesn't matter when we have faith and hope .
        I am not a great fan of Ernest Hemingway because his books are too descriptive and flamboyant. But this is a nice book for a one time read.`,

        It was written by Brene Brown. This is one of the best book that I have ever read. The book clearly says, there is nothing wrong in being imperfect. All you require is Courage. Courage to trust ourself. Courage to be Compassionate. Courage to do right things without any self-doubt. Courage to define shame. Courage to be resilient.
        
        Dr.Brene leaves the readers with a feeling of hope. At the end of the day, no matter what gets done, we are enough. Yes, we are imperfect and vulnerable… but that doesn’t change the truth that each of us is worthy of love and belonging.

        Jalal mohammad, a rich muslim guy falls in love with Jodha, a traditional middle class hindu girl. Their love blooms amidst all the indifferences in their cultures and traditions. To succeed in love, they have to fight all the stereotypes put forth by the society, baseless traditions , family and the emotions that are thrown at them. But little do they know, these are not the only obstacles they have to face.
        
        
        This is the best novel i have ever read till date. I have lost count of the times I have read it again and again. This is not the cliché love story where a guy falls in love with a girl at first sight and the Starcrossed lovers end up falling apart while one of them dies in the end. Rather, this is a story of those who fall in love with someone from different community. Especially in india, love is not a widely accepted concept. Loving someone from different caste? It's totally a different story. There are people who will not even hesitate to kill their child in the name of honour killing just because their child has fallen in love with a person from another caste. The countries with so many traditions still don't approve intercaste marriages. But heart doesn't listen to all that. Does it? How is loving a person from different community a sin while marrying an unknown person from the same caste is normal? Being an Indian girl from a conservative family myself, i can feel it in my heart what the leads in the story have undergone in their lives. The author has taken so much care to sculpt each and every charater of the story in a meticulous way to make the readers have the feel of empathy. This is not only a love story, it's about bravery, fidelity, trust, friendship, passion, obsession, courage, standing up for one's self and what not. This is not about just a passionate affair.

        The book revolves around the lives of two women, Mariam and Laila amidst the terrors of the war stricken Afghanistan.
        
        This is a book, where every women can get a glimpse of their lives in the lives of Mariam and Laila. The heart wrenching story of Mariam can leave you in a myriad of emotions. The story of laila is not any lesser. This book has all the elements to make your stomach churn and your heart weep.
        
        I wouldn't want to give away any spoilers, but I would say, you wouldn't want to continue this book at some point.. Even I stopped.. I didn't want to read further, because my heart could only take so much.. but still I continued. And I insist you to continue as well. For the story gets better in the end.
        
        The lives of women, especially those under oppression are portrayed in each and every word of the book. When you read it, you will go through a ride of torments and violence which you will never even want to imagine happening to any women. But that's how women really lived and still live in some countries, suppressed, used and denied of their rights to live.
        
        The beauty of this book is that, it will prove you wrong every time you make any judgements on it. It will not guarantee you a perfect happy ending but you can consider it as one in some minimal aspect. This is a must read, but if violence offends you, then i wouldn't recommend this to you.
        No words can do justice to the way Khaled hosseini has written each and every word of this book.

        The book consists of 5 sections namely wilting, falling, rooting, rising and blooming.
        Just like how a flower wilts and falls, then roots and rises to bloom into a new flower.. the poet potrays the phases of emotional turmoil one has to go through in heartbreaks. Through the poems the poet reflects on growing through the struggles and pains.
        
        I have always been a fan of her writing. The way they emotionally connect with me as if they are written for me is something that makes it even better to read them. Rupi Kaur is so good in playing with words and I love that so much. The book deals with heartbreaks, pain, growing through pain, struggles of immigrants, love of a mother and self love.
        What i love the most about the book is, it always emphasizes self love and body positivity which most of the people lack nowadays. But at the same time it deals with mature topics which are not suitable for certain age group who are not adults yet. I would recommend this to adults.
        Especially if you are heartbroken or hateful towards yourself because the book promotes so much of positivity which will help you to love yourself and grow through your struggles and pain.
